67-442: iPhone Pricer
---
This was a simple demo project to demonstrate some features of CoreML.  A couple of notes:

- The data was only about 200 records of iPhone 8 sellers online and the model is just simple linear regression. 
- In the `ML_creation_files` directory, there is a csv file with some pricing data as well as a Python file to convert it into `.mlmodel` file.  
- To help, I've also included the terminal output to show the steps I took to make the conversion to a `.mlmodel`.
